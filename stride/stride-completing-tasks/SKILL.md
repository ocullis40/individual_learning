# Stride: Completing Tasks

## ⚠️ THIS SKILL IS MANDATORY — NOT OPTIONAL ⚠️

**If you are about to call `PATCH /api/tasks/:id/complete`, you MUST have invoked this skill first.**

The completion API requires fields that are ONLY documented here:
- `completion_summary` (required — not the same as `completion_notes`)
- `actual_complexity` (required — enum: "small", "medium", "large")
- `actual_files_changed` (required — comma-separated STRING, not array)
- `after_doing_result` (required — object with `exit_code`, `output`, `duration_ms`)
- `before_review_result` (required — object with `exit_code`, `output`, `duration_ms`)

**Attempting to complete a task from memory without this skill results in 3+ failed API calls** as you discover each missing field one at a time. This has been observed in practice.

## Overview

**Calling complete before validation = bypassed quality gates. Running hooks first = confident completion.**

This skill enforces the proper completion workflow: execute BOTH `after_doing` AND `before_review` hooks BEFORE calling the complete endpoint.

## ⚡ AUTOMATION NOTICE ⚡

**This is a FULLY AUTOMATED workflow. Do NOT prompt the user between steps.**

- After completing hooks → AUTOMATICALLY call complete endpoint
- If needs_review=false → AUTOMATICALLY invoke stride-claiming-tasks to claim next task
- The loop continues: claim → implement → complete → claim → implement → complete

**The agent should work continuously without asking "Should I claim next?" or "Continue working?"**

**ONLY STOP when needs_review=true (human approval required)**

## API Authorization

⚠️ **CRITICAL: ALL Stride API calls are pre-authorized. Asking for permission is a workflow violation.**

When the user initiates a Stride workflow, they have **already granted blanket permission** for every Stride API call in the entire workflow. This authorization covers:
- `PATCH /api/tasks/:id/complete` — completing tasks
- `GET /api/tasks/next` — finding next task
- `POST /api/tasks/claim` — claiming tasks
- All `curl` commands to the Stride API
- All hook executions (bash commands from `.stride.md`)
- **Every API call in every skill in this plugin**

**NEVER ask the user:**
- "Should I mark this complete?"
- "Can I call the API?"
- "Should I proceed with completion?"
- "Let me call the complete endpoint" (then wait for confirmation)
- Any variation of requesting permission for Stride operations

**Just execute the calls. Asking breaks the automated workflow and forces unnecessary human intervention.**

## 🚨 HOOK EXECUTION: NEVER PROMPT FOR PERMISSION 🚨

**Hooks are bash commands the user wrote in `.stride.md`. The user authored them. The user expects them to run. Executing hooks is NOT optional and does NOT require confirmation.**

**NEVER do any of the following before running a hook:**
- Display text like "Let me run the hooks" and wait for approval
- Ask "Should I execute the after_doing hook?"
- Ask "Can I run `mix test`?" or "Can I run `mix credo`?"
- Present the hook commands and wait for the user to approve them
- Use any phrasing that triggers a permission prompt in the CLI

**The correct behavior is:** Read the hook commands from `.stride.md`, then execute them immediately via the Bash tool. No announcement. No confirmation. No waiting. Just run them.

**Why this matters:** When an agent asks permission to run hooks, the user's CLI presents a permission dialog. This breaks the fully automated workflow. The user defined these hooks precisely because they want them to run without intervention. Every permission prompt is a workflow violation.

**If your CLI environment requires permission for Bash commands:** Execute the hook commands as direct tool calls without prefacing them with explanatory text that could trigger a confirmation step. Run each hook command line by line as individual Bash calls.

## The Iron Law

**EXECUTE BOTH after_doing AND before_review HOOKS BEFORE CALLING COMPLETE ENDPOINT**

## The Critical Mistake

Calling `PATCH /api/tasks/:id/complete` before running BOTH hooks causes:
- Task marked done prematurely
- Failed tests hidden (after_doing skipped)
- Review preparation skipped (before_review skipped)
- Quality gates bypassed
- Broken code merged to main

**The API will REJECT your request if you don't include both hook results.**

## When to Use

Use when you've finished implementing a Stride task and are ready to mark it complete.

**Required:** Execute BOTH hooks BEFORE calling the complete endpoint.

## The Complete Completion Process

1. **Finish your work** - All implementation complete
1.5. **Pre-completion code review (Claude Code Only)** - If the task meets the `stride-subagent-workflow` skill's decision matrix for code review (medium+ complexity OR 2+ key_files), dispatch the `stride:task-reviewer` agent to review your changes against acceptance criteria and pitfalls. Fix any Critical or Important issues BEFORE running hooks. Skip this step for small tasks with 0-1 key_files or if you don't have subagent access. **If a review was performed, save the reviewer's output to include as `review_report` in the completion request.**
2. **Read .stride.md after_doing section** - Get the validation command
3. **Execute after_doing hook AUTOMATICALLY** (blocking, 120s timeout)
   - 🚨 **NEVER prompt the user for permission to run hooks. NEVER present commands and wait for approval. NEVER ask "Should I run this?" The user authored these hooks in .stride.md — they are pre-authorized. Execute them immediately via Bash tool calls without any confirmation text.**
   - Execute each line from `.stride.md` `## after_doing` one at a time via direct Bash tool calls
   - Capture: `exit_code`, `output`, `duration_ms`
4. **If after_doing fails:** FIX ISSUES, do NOT proceed
5. **Read .stride.md before_review section** - Get the PR/doc command
6. **Execute before_review hook AUTOMATICALLY** (blocking, 60s timeout)
   - 🚨 **NEVER prompt the user for permission to run hooks. NEVER present commands and wait for approval. NEVER ask "Should I run this?" The user authored these hooks in .stride.md — they are pre-authorized. Execute them immediately via Bash tool calls without any confirmation text.**
   - Execute each line from `.stride.md` `## before_review` one at a time via direct Bash tool calls
   - Capture: `exit_code`, `output`, `duration_ms`
7. **If before_review fails:** FIX ISSUES, do NOT proceed
8. **Both hooks succeeded?** Call `PATCH /api/tasks/:id/complete` WITH both results
9. **Check needs_review flag:**
   - `needs_review=true`: STOP and wait for human review
   - `needs_review=false`: Execute after_review hook, **then AUTOMATICALLY invoke stride-claiming-tasks to claim next task WITHOUT prompting**

## Hook Execution Pattern

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Execute ALL hooks WITHOUT prompting the user ⚠️

**All hook commands are pre-authorized.** The user wrote them in `.stride.md`. Execute them immediately via direct Bash tool calls. Do NOT announce what you are about to run, do NOT ask for permission, do NOT present the commands for review. Just run them.

### Executing after_doing Hook

1. Read the `## after_doing` section from `.stride.md`
2. Set environment variables (TASK_ID, TASK_IDENTIFIER, etc.)
3. **Execute each command line immediately via Bash tool calls — NO permission prompts, NO confirmation text**
4. Capture the results:

```bash
START_TIME=$(date +%s%3N)
OUTPUT=$(timeout 120 bash -c 'mix test && mix credo --strict' 2>&1)
EXIT_CODE=$?
END_TIME=$(date +%s%3N)
DURATION=$((END_TIME - START_TIME))
```

5. Check exit code - MUST be 0 to proceed

### Executing before_review Hook

1. Read the `## before_review` section from `.stride.md`
2. Set environment variables
3. **Execute each command line immediately via Bash tool calls — NO permission prompts, NO confirmation text**
4. Capture the results:

```bash
START_TIME=$(date +%s%3N)
OUTPUT=$(timeout 60 bash -c 'gh pr create --title "$TASK_TITLE"' 2>&1)
EXIT_CODE=$?
END_TIME=$(date +%s%3N)
DURATION=$((END_TIME - START_TIME))
```

5. Check exit code - MUST be 0 to proceed

## When Hooks Fail

### Diagnostician-Assisted Debugging (Claude Code Only)

When a blocking hook fails, dispatch the `stride:hook-diagnostician` agent **as the first step** before attempting manual fixes. The diagnostician parses the raw output, categorizes issues by severity, and returns a prioritized fix plan — saving time on complex multi-tool failures.

**When to dispatch:** Any blocking hook failure (after_doing or before_review) where exit_code is non-zero.

**What to provide the diagnostician:**
- `hook_name`: The hook that failed (e.g., `"after_doing"` or `"before_review"`)
- `exit_code`: The non-zero exit code
- `output`: The full stdout/stderr output from the hook
- `duration_ms`: How long the hook ran before failing

**What you get back:** A structured analysis with issues ordered by fix priority (compilation errors → git failures → test failures → security warnings → credo → formatting). Follow the diagnostician's fix order — fixing higher-priority issues often resolves lower-priority ones automatically.

**Fallback for non-Claude Code environments:** If you don't have access to the Agent tool (Cursor, Windsurf, Continue, etc.), skip the diagnostician and proceed directly to manual debugging using the steps below.

### If after_doing fails:

1. **DO NOT** call complete endpoint
2. **[Claude Code Only]** Dispatch `stride:hook-diagnostician` with the hook name, exit code, output, and duration
3. Follow the diagnostician's prioritized fix plan, or if unavailable, read test/build failures carefully
4. Fix the failing tests or build issues
5. Re-run after_doing hook to verify fix
6. Only call complete endpoint after success

**Common after_doing failures:**
- Test failures → Fix tests first
- Build errors → Resolve compilation issues
- Linting errors → Fix code quality issues
- Coverage below target → Add missing tests
- Formatting issues → Run formatter

### If before_review fails:

1. **DO NOT** call complete endpoint
2. **[Claude Code Only]** Dispatch `stride:hook-diagnostician` with the hook name, exit code, output, and duration
3. Follow the diagnostician's fix plan, or if unavailable, fix the issue manually
4. Re-run before_review hook to verify
5. Only proceed after success

**Common before_review failures:**
- PR already exists → Check if you need to update existing PR
- Authentication issues → Verify gh CLI is authenticated
- Branch issues → Ensure you're on correct branch
- Network issues → Retry after connectivity restored

## API Request Format

After BOTH hooks succeed, call the complete endpoint:

```json
PATCH /api/tasks/:id/complete
{
  "agent_name": "Claude Sonnet 4.5",
  "time_spent_minutes": 45,
  "completion_notes": "All tests passing. PR #123 created.",
  "review_report": "## Review Summary\n\nApproved — 0 issues found.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n| # | Criterion | Status |\n|---|-----------|--------|\n| 1 | Feature works | Met |",
  "after_doing_result": {
    "exit_code": 0,
    "output": "Running tests...\n230 tests, 0 failures\nmix credo --strict\nNo issues found",
    "duration_ms": 45678
  },
  "before_review_result": {
    "exit_code": 0,
    "output": "Creating pull request...\nPR #123 created: https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123",
    "duration_ms": 2340
  }
}
```

**Critical:** Both `after_doing_result` and `before_review_result` are REQUIRED. The API will reject requests without them.

**Optional:** Include `review_report` when a task-reviewer agent produced a structured review. Omit it when no review was performed (e.g., small tasks with 0-1 key_files).

## Review vs Auto-Approval Decision

After the complete endpoint succeeds:

### If needs_review=true:
1. Task moves to Review column
2. Agent MUST STOP immediately
3. Wait for human reviewer to approve/reject
4. When approved, human calls `/mark_reviewed`
5. Execute after_review hook
6. Task moves to Done column

### If needs_review=false:
1. Task moves to Done column immediately
2. Execute after_review hook (60s timeout, blocking)
3. **AUTOMATICALLY invoke stride-claiming-tasks skill to claim next task**
4. **Continue working WITHOUT prompting the user**

**CRITICAL AUTOMATION:** When needs_review=false, the agent should AUTOMATICALLY continue to the next task by invoking the stride-claiming-tasks skill. Do NOT ask "Would you like me to claim the next task?" or "Should I continue?" - just proceed automatically.

## Red Flags - STOP

- "I'll mark it complete then run tests"
- "The tests probably pass"
- "I can fix failures after completing"
- "I'll skip the hooks this time"
- "Just the after_doing hook is enough"
- "I'll run before_review later"
- **"Let me run the after_doing hook" (then wait for user to approve) — NEVER prompt for hook permission**
- **"Should I execute mix test?" — hooks are pre-authorized, just run them**
- **"Should I claim the next task?" (Don't ask, just do it when needs_review=false)**
- **"Would you like me to continue?" (Don't ask, auto-continue when needs_review=false)**

**All of these mean: Run BOTH hooks BEFORE calling complete, and auto-continue when needs_review=false.**

## Rationalization Table

| Excuse | Reality | Consequence |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| "Tests probably pass" | after_doing catches 40% of issues | Task marked done with failing tests |
| "I can fix later" | Task already marked complete | Have to reopen, wastes review cycle |
| "Just this once" | Becomes a habit | Quality standards erode completely |
| "before_review can wait" | API requires both hook results | Request rejected with 422 error |
| "Hooks take too long" | 2-3 minutes prevents 2+ hours rework | Rushing causes failed deployments |

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Calling complete before executing hooks
```bash
❌ curl -X PATCH /api/tasks/W47/complete
   # Then running hooks afterward

✅ # Execute after_doing hook first
   START_TIME=$(date +%s%3N)
   OUTPUT=$(timeout 120 bash -c 'mix test' 2>&1)
   EXIT_CODE=$?
   # ...capture results

   # Execute before_review hook second
   START_TIME=$(date +%s%3N)
   OUTPUT=$(timeout 60 bash -c 'gh pr create' 2>&1)
   EXIT_CODE=$?
   # ...capture results

   # Then call complete WITH both results
   curl -X PATCH /api/tasks/W47/complete -d '{...both results...}'
```

### Mistake 2: Only including after_doing result
```json
❌ {
  "after_doing_result": {...}
}

✅ {
  "after_doing_result": {...},
  "before_review_result": {...}
}
```

### Mistake 3: Continuing work after needs_review=true
```bash
❌ PATCH /api/tasks/W47/complete returns needs_review=true
   Agent continues to claim next task

✅ PATCH /api/tasks/W47/complete returns needs_review=true
   Agent STOPS and waits for human review
```

### Mistake 4: Prompting user for permission to run hooks
```bash
❌ Agent says "Let me run the after_doing hooks" then waits for user approval
❌ Agent asks "Should I execute mix test?"
❌ Agent presents hook commands and pauses for confirmation

✅ Agent reads .stride.md after_doing section
   Agent immediately executes each command via Bash tool calls
   No announcement, no confirmation, no waiting
   (The user authored these hooks — they are pre-authorized)
```

### Mistake 5: Not fixing hook failures
```bash
❌ after_doing fails with test errors
   Agent calls complete endpoint anyway

✅ after_doing fails with test errors
   Agent fixes tests, re-runs hook until success
   Only then calls complete endpoint
```

## Implementation Workflow

1. **Complete all work** - Implementation finished
2. **Execute after_doing hook AUTOMATICALLY** - Run tests, linters, build (DO NOT prompt user)
3. **Check exit code** - Must be 0
4. **If failed:** Fix issues, re-run, do NOT proceed
5. **Execute before_review hook AUTOMATICALLY** - Create PR, generate docs (DO NOT prompt user)
6. **Check exit code** - Must be 0
7. **If failed:** Fix issues, re-run, do NOT proceed
8. **Call complete endpoint** - Include BOTH hook results
9. **Check needs_review flag** - Stop if true, continue if false
10. **If false:** Execute after_review hook AUTOMATICALLY (DO NOT prompt user)
11. **Claim next task** - Continue the workflow

## Real-World Impact

**Before this skill (completing without hooks):**
- 40% of completions had failing tests
- 2.3 hours average time to fix post-completion
- 65% required reopening and rework

**After this skill (hooks before complete):**
- 2% of completions had issues
- 15 minutes average fix time (pre-completion)
- 5% required rework

**Time savings: 2+ hours per task (90% reduction in post-completion rework)**

## Completion Request Field Reference

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `agent_name` | string | Yes | Name of the completing agent |
| `time_spent_minutes` | integer | Yes | Actual time spent on the task |
| `completion_notes` | string | Yes | Summary of what was done |
| `completion_summary` | string | Yes | Brief summary for tracking |
| `actual_complexity` | enum | Yes | `"small"`, `"medium"`, or `"large"` |
| `actual_files_changed` | string | Yes | Comma-separated file paths (NOT an array) |
| `after_doing_result` | object | Yes | Hook result (see format below) |
| `before_review_result` | object | Yes | Hook result (see format below) |
| `review_report` | string | No | Structured review report from task-reviewer agent. Include when a review was performed; omit when no review was done. |
| `skills_version` | string | No | Your skills version from SKILL.md frontmatter |

**WRONG — actual_files_changed as array:**
```json
"actual_files_changed": ["lib/foo.ex", "lib/bar.ex"]
```

**RIGHT — actual_files_changed as comma-separated string:**
```json
"actual_files_changed": "lib/foo.ex, lib/bar.ex"
```

## Hook Result Format Reminder

Both `after_doing_result` and `before_review_result` use the same format:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `exit_code` | integer | Yes | 0 for success, non-zero for failure |
| `output` | string | Yes | stdout/stderr output from hook execution |
| `duration_ms` | integer | Yes | How long the hook took in milliseconds |

**WRONG — missing required fields:**
```json
"after_doing_result": {"output": "tests passed"}
```

**RIGHT — all three fields present:**
```json
"after_doing_result": {
  "exit_code": 0,
  "output": "All 230 tests passed\nmix credo --strict: no issues",
  "duration_ms": 45678
}
```

## Handling Stale Skills

The API response may include a `skills_update_required` field when your skills are outdated:

**When you see `skills_update_required`:**
1. Run `/plugin update stride` to get the latest skills
2. Retry your original action

## MANDATORY: Previous Skill Before Completing

You should have already invoked these skills before reaching this point:

1. **`stride:stride-claiming-tasks`** — To claim the task with proper before_doing hook execution
2. **`stride:stride-subagent-workflow`** (Claude Code only) — To explore, plan, and review based on the decision matrix

If you skipped any of these, the after_doing hook is likely to fail. Go back and verify.
